"""The POS discount pipeline — ordered, composable, idempotent.

``pos_next.api.invoices.apply_offers`` is the *only* engine that runs for a POS
cart. ``update_invoice`` sets ``ignore_pricing_rule = 1`` and clears every
line's ``pricing_rules`` before saving, so ERPNext never recomputes and whatever
this pipeline produces is what gets persisted. Non-POS documents are untouched
by this module: they go through ERPNext's own engine plus the Min/Max
``validate`` hook in :mod:`pos_next.overrides.pricing_rule`.

Why an accumulator
------------------
Each pass used to *assign* ``discount_percentage``, so whichever ran last won
and discounts could never combine. Passes here instead contribute a **named
percentage part** to each line:

    baseline (whatever ERPNext's per-item engine already produced)
      + part["auto_discount"]
      + part["accumulative"]        (added in a later stage)
      = discount_percentage

Parts are keyed by source, so a second contribution from the *same* pass
replaces its earlier value (matching how a single pass has always behaved)
while contributions from *different* passes sum. Every part is rebuilt from
scratch on each run, so running the pipeline twice over the same cart yields
the same numbers rather than compounding them.
